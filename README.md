# Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Complex Job Shop Scheduling

## Project Overview

This project aims to address the **Complex Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)** using a **Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (GA)** with specialized constraint handling. The project explores the development of a custom GA framework tailored to optimize job scheduling across machines while considering multiple operational constraints such as machine availability, maintenance, and task dependencies. The algorithm is designed for flexible use in various industries requiring efficient scheduling.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: 
  - Includes custom fitness functions, selection methods, crossover, and mutation operations for optimal schedule generation.
  - Incorporates real-world constraints like machine cooldowns, maintenance, and job priorities.
- **User Interface**:
  - Developed using Python and PyQt5 to offer a user-friendly GUI for data input, simulation setup, and real-time progress visualization.
  - Users can select datasets, configure GA parameters, and visualize scheduling results.
- **Visualization & Reporting**:
  - Real-time job schedule generation with performance metrics.
  - Exports detailed reports with schedule summaries and optimization results.

## Project Structure

- `GA_Optimization_Engine/` - Contains the main genetic algorithm engine, including all selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness functions.
- `GUI/` - User interface components for interacting with the system, selecting datasets, and viewing results.
- `data/` - Example datasets for jobs and machines.
- `reports/` - Generated reports and timelines of schedules.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for implementing the GA and GUI.
- **PyQt5**: For developing the graphical user interface.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the schedule timelines.
- **CSV**: Datasets are provided in CSV format for easy manipulation.
